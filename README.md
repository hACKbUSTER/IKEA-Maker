### The Issue

Despite all the pre-shopping and in-shopping enhancement, few pay attention to after shopping experience. For most of the fans of IKEA, assembling and making things with their own hands is definitely one of the most important reasons for their love to IKEA, but many of them could not understand the paper manual very well so that they are not able to fully enjoy the procedure of making.

### What will MAKER do

Instead of paper manual with illustration, we give our users straight-forward guide in the real world through AR technology. Users could see the next step in the AR view which is adding to the real world, and we can even check whether users are holding the right type of screw or not using computer vision through camera. Thus, we will make assembling a joyful thing for all the IKEA lovers.
